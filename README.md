# Personal recipe tracker built using Ruby on Rails

## Getting started

To work with this app locally, clone the repo and then install gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Run the test suite:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
